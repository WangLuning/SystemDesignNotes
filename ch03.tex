\section{Step1}
Understand the problem and establish design scope\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item user location update
    \item navigation service, traveling from one place to another
    \item map rendering
\end{itemize}
Non-funtional requirements:\\
accuracy\\
smooth rendering\\
data and battery usage: use cache, and design how to get maps\\
Items that need to consider:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Geohashing: from name of place to location long and lat\\
    \item Geohashing: 00, 01, 10, 11\\
    \item Map rendering: retrieve an area\\
    \item road navigation: A*\\
    \item hierarchical routing tiles: download one tile at a time\\
\end{itemize}
Storage estimation:\\
Each grid splits into 4:\\
\begin{equation}
   50PB + \frac{50}{4}PB+\frac{50}{4*4}PB = 67PB 
\end{equation}
Throughput estimation:\\
1 billion DAU => QPS\\
\section{Step2}
Propose High-level Design\\
two services:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item location service:\\
    keep sending second-level location to service\\
    Do not need to do 1-sec, can do multisecond in a batch\\
    write heavy, can use casssandra\\
    \item navigation service:\\
    send a http request, keeps connection\\
    include start location and destination\\
    \item a cache service
\end{itemize}
Map rendering:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item load a prefixed size tile (as in geohash we have fixed size tile)\\
    \item use a local cache to cache used tiles\\
    \item when receiving a request, sending this tile and its 8 surrounding tile to make sure the boundary is included
\end{itemize}
