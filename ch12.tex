\maketitle
the single version is simple:\\
transact from one user's digital wallet to another user's digital wallet\\
So the main idea of this chapter is how to build reliable distributed system\\
atomic transaction\\
\section{Step 1}
Transaction Per Second (TPS) is high\\
So we need distributed storage\\
\section{Step 2}
Propose High-level Design\\
\textbf{API design}
POST balance transfer from one account to another\\
Sharding solution: several redis, each performing 1000 transactions\\
if two users are in two different redis, how to ensure it is atomic (succeed in both DB)\\
can also use relation db, each DB satisfies ACID\\
but it also needs to ensure atomic between DBs
\textbf{solution}:\\
use 2 phase commit\\
or try-confirm/cancel operation
