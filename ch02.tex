\section{Step1}
Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope\\
Different from Proximity Service, in that friends nearby keep changing\\
Need to receive \textbf{PUSH} notification from friends\\
Estimation:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item 100 million DAU
    \item 10\% enable this service
    \item user update location every 30 seconds\\
    \item location update QPS for every single one $\frac{10 million}{30} = 0.3million$
\end{itemize}
\section{Step2}
Propose High-Level Design\\
\subsection{initial idea}
peer to peer\\
Bad: open to many connections w/o control\\
\subsection{a shared backend}
each user has a backend, which connects to all close nearby friends\\
If still connected to all friends\\
Suppose each user has 400 friends in list:\\
Update received $QPS = 400 * 0.3 million = 120 million$ is too much
\subsection{using Redis Pub/Sub}
Do not receive indifferently from all 400 friends\\
need a gateway to check, if distance is close, then push the notification to Redis Pub/Sub and let the subscriber know\\
Need a \textbf{STATEFUL WebSocket API}
\begin{itemize}
    \item push periodic location update
    \item client receive location update
    \item webSocket initialization
    \item subscribe to a new friend
    \item unsubscribe a friend
\end{itemize}
\subsection{data model}
can use kv pair as Redis cache\\
Since the location keeps updating\\
We do not use a db since that changes too frequently
\section{Step3}
Deep dive\\
abot how to initialize when client starts:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item loads all the friends from database\\
    \item request location cache to fetch the latest location (if TTL alive)
    \item use the retrieved to calculate nearby friend list and return to client\\
    \item subscribe to all active and inactive friends (the cost of creating a channel is low, so we can create for all friends in list)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Redis Pub/Sub server count}
\subsubsection{Memory}
\begin{itemize}
    \item For the 100 million DAU, we create 100 million channels
    \item 20 bytes of pointers to track each subscriber
    \item total $100 million * 100 active friends * 20 bytes = 200 GB$
\end{itemize}
So if each server has 100 million memory, need 2 servers.
\subsubsection{Latency}
The whole servers receive 120 million\\
if each server QPS is 100k\\
We need 120 servers\\
