First think of it as single machine\\
then think how to scale it as distributed\\
\section{Step 1}
Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item real-time update score once the user finishes a game
    \item score reflected on leaderboard
    \item leaderboard shows top 10 users
    \item user find its ranking place in the leaderboard
\end{itemize}
Estimation:\\
5 million DAU\\
QPS: around 500 at peak time\\
\section{Step 2}
Propose High-level Design\\
API design:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item post user score once he finishes
    \item get top 10 user scoreboard
    \item get my own score
\end{itemize}
\textbf{High-level Architecture}
\begin{itemize}
    \item end user
    \item game service: can use a message queue if there are multiple consumers\\
    consumers include leaderboard service and notification service and analytics service etc.\\
    \item leaderboard service: user do not send PUT request to this directly as not secure
    \item leaderboard score
\end{itemize}
\textbf{What database}
relational database: not suitable for ranking and heavy update\\
Redis: works good in memory\\
so it can do in-memory ranking, using skip list or redis sorted set\\
\section{Step 3}
Design Deep Dive\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item build service on the cloud\\
    use AWS lambda API so it can autoscale\\
    \item storage partition\\
    can partition by user score [0,100],[100,200]...\\
    using redis replica\\
    \item using NoSQL as alternative:\\
    write heavy, in different partition\\
    to get top 10, get top 10 of each shard and merge them together\\
\end{itemize}
