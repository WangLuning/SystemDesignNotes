Main idea:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item still the database is the most important thing
    \item do aggregation and store the data
    \item need to scale more, so more scaling and map-reduce
    \item has some TCP latency and data missing issue
    \item this is an extension of Chapter 5
\end{itemize}
\section{Step1}
Understand the Problem and Establish Design Scope\\
functional support:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item aggregate $ad_id$ in M minutes
    \item return top 100 most clicked ads in every minute
    \item support filter by country, region
    \item ad click 1 billion per day, so QPS = 10000
\end{itemize}
\section{Step2}
Propose High-level Design\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item API1:\\
    aggregate count
    \item API2:\\
    reurn most clicked ad in minute
    \item data model\\
    write heavy, not read heavy\\
    use Casandra or InfluxDB
\end{itemize}
High level flow:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item log watcher
    \item data aggregation service (push mode)\\
    in push mode, we can use kafka as buffer
    \item database
    write two kinds of data:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item raw data as cold data
        \item aggregated data: map-reduce
    \end{itemize}
    \item query service
\end{itemize}
\section{Step3}
Design Deep Dive\\
items to discuss:
\begin{itemize}
    \item streaming and batching:\\
    why we need streaming and batching:\\
    streaming to process current data, batching to re-process old cold data\\
    two architecture design:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item lambda design, two pipelines, one for batching one for streaming
        \item kappa design, streaming and batching merged in one pipeline
    \end{itemize}
    \item time and aggregation window\\
    some msg arrive late, getting wrong order and outside window
    \item delivery guarantee:\\
    use kafaka queue to guarantee delivery semantics
    \item scale the system:\\
    hotspot issue: in map-reduce, a $ad_id$ is too popular
    \item data monitor and correctness
    \item fault tolerance
\end{itemize}
