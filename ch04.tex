\section{Step1}
Understand the problem and establish the design scope\\
traditional MQ: does not retain messages once delivered\\
Delivery semantics:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item at most once
    \item at least once
    \item exact once
\end{itemize}
procedure:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item producer send msgs to MQ
    \item consumer consumes msgs from MQ
    \item msg can be repeated or once
    \item historical data can be truncated (do not lose it in 2 weeks)
    \item msg size kbs
    \item deliver in the same order
    \item delivery semantics
\end{itemize}
\section{Step2}
Propose High-Level Design\\
Msg model:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item Point-to-point:\\
    one msg into MQ and consumed by a single customer
    \item Publish-Subscribe:\\
    topics, partitions, brokers\\
    if writing in order, we can guarantee it received in order\\
    consumer group: one in the group receives one topic partition
\end{itemize}
High-Level Architecture:\\
Apache zookeeper\\
\section{Step3}
Design Deep Dive\\
data storage:
read heavy and write heavy\\
no very suitable database: use write-ahead log (WAL) sequentially on disk\\
Batching:\\
can happen in producer, MQ, consumer\\
Cosumer flow:\\
How to get msg from MQ:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item push mode:\\
    MQ pushes to consumer w/o knowing if consumer has capacity
    \item pull mode:\\
    consumer actively read from MQ and add to offset
\end{itemize}
MQ replication:\\
in-sync replica (ISR):\\
a broker has several replicas to guarantee availability\\
producer send to one lead broker\\
this broker forward the msg to other replicas:\\
get ACK from its replica:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item ACK = all\\
    make sure all the replica has received the msg
    \item ACK = 1\\
    this 1 comes from the lead, meaning producer does not monitor how the lead forwards to replicas
    \item ACK = 0\\
    producer sends msg, and does not wait for MQ to respond
\end{itemize}
Delivery semantics:\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item at-most once\\
    \begin{itemize}
        \item producer send to MQ once, and deletes it
        \item consumer fetch from MQ, and send response to MQ before consumer processes data. So even if consumer process fails, it cannot fetch the same msg from MQ again.
    \end{itemize}
    \item at-least once
    \begin{itemize}
        \item producer sends msg to MQ and wait for AKC > 0
        \item consumer fetches msg and process the data. After processing success, send response to MQ to move offset.
    \end{itemize}
    \item exactly once
\end{itemize}
