\maketitle
the original idea is simple
\begin{itemize}
    \item pay-in flow: from customer to service
    \item pay-out flow: from service to seller
\end{itemize}
\section{Step 1}
Understand the Problem and Propose High-level Design\\
design two flows and think of how to scale it\\
should be simple
\section{Step 2}
Propose High-level Design\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item end user
    \item payment service
    \item record payment service db
    \item record ledger db
    \item record user wallet db
    \item payment executor
    \item link to external payment service provider (PSP)
\end{itemize}
\textbf{API design}
\begin{itemize}
    \item POST payment
    \item get by specific payment id
\end{itemize}
\textbf{database}
use relational DB to ensure ACID\\
\section{Step 3}
Design Deep Dive\\
\textbf{PSP Integration}\\
payment service links to  PSP, during this interaction what should we show to users?\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item user click checkout (payment not started)
    \item enter payment service
    \item communicate with PSP to create payment nonce
    \item store the returned token
    \item display payment page to user browser
    \item user starts payment
    \item redirect to completion page
\end{itemize}
\textbf{reconciliation}\\
every night PSP confirms with payment DB (ledger and wallet db)\\
to confirm all payments are correctly recorded\\
\textbf{Message queue}\\
from payment service to multiple others\\
e.g. ledger, wallet, payment service\\
\textbf{Error handling}\\
if transient error, use a queue to store it and retry
